#The Sudoku Board Solver
Sudoku is a Japanese game that requires the user to fill out a 9 x 9 numerical grid by using only numbers 1 - 9. The conditions are that:
* There are 9 3 x 3 subgrids, and within these all numbers must be unique.
* Every row must contain the numbers 1 - 9 and every column must also contain the numbers 1 - 9.

This repository contains different versions of a Sudoku puzzle solver designed to work for 9x9 grids. Each of these methods uses a (slightly) different algorithmic implementation to solve the board. By all means these are NOT the only ways to do this but this works!

##Board Checker
Regardless of the algorithm that is used, the board will have to be checked. Either routinely throughout the algorithm or at the end of the program.
